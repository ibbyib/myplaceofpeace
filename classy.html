<h2>web designer in training</h2>
<div class="p1">
<p>
	Pursuing my web design dream. I hope to one day learn all that there is to know about the ever-growing HTML5 and CSS scripts, and hopefully even Javascript.
</p>

<h3>About me</h3>
<div class="p2">
<p>I enjoy playing video games, writing code, watching movies, t.v.shows, and Youtube videos. I would love to learn more about code than I already do, as my current knowledge is limited to basic html5 and css3.</p>
</div>
<h4>What I would Like to Do</h4>
<div class="life">
<p>I would love to work for a company at some point in my life. Any company, just so long as I have fun and I am productive. I would also like to try working at home sometime. Could be a nice experience! Also, game design is a really interesting thing for me as well.</p>
